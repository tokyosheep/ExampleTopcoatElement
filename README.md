This is example how create input form on topcoat css Adobe CEP

topcoat css is default css on adobe CEP but bit dificult to use it for non professtonal web developer
base code was imported through Node module 
ECMA6 import system doesn't work on Adobe CEP
under babel transpiles It works but ECMA6 import and themeManager don't work together
so It use Node module instaed of ECMA import even without babel
and It works with themeManager

I hope the example helps someone's task or study
