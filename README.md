This is example how create input form on topcoat css Adobe Illustrator CEP

topcoat css is default css on adobe CEP but bit dificult to use it for non professtonal web developer
but the css is convenience to use as a default css
so I show you how create the form throguh js

specifically 
get color data from pathItems you selected
create list and write color data and topcoat checkbox as well

base code is imported through Node module 
ECMA6 import system doesn't work on Adobe CEP
under babel transpiles It works but ECMA6 import and themeManager don't work together
so It use Node module instaed of ECMA import even without babel
and It works with themeManager

I hope the example helps someone's task or study
